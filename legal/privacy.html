    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: 2025-12-29</p>

    <p>
      Payment Calendar lets you manage payments without creating an account.
      Your data is stored locally on your device unless you enable iCloud sync.
    </p>

    <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We do not collect personal data, usage analytics, or crash logs through third-party SDKs.</li>
      <li>We do not use advertising or tracking.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data You Create</h2>
    <p>
      Payments, notes, reminders, and settings are stored locally on your device.
      You can delete this data at any time from within the app or by removing the app.
    </p>

    <h2>App Store Analytics</h2>
    <p>
      Apple may provide us aggregated, non-personal App Store analytics. We do not
      receive personal identifiers or individual usage data.
    </p>

    <h2>iCloud Sync (Optional)</h2>
    <p>
      If you enable iCloud sync, your data is stored in your private iCloud
      container using Apple CloudKit. Apple may process that data according to
      their privacy policies. We do not have access to your iCloud credentials.
      You can disable iCloud sync in the app settings to keep data local.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your data with third parties.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>
      Local data remains on your device until you delete it or remove the app.
      If iCloud sync is enabled, data is stored in your private iCloud container
      and can be removed by disabling iCloud for the app or managing iCloud storage.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this policy from time to time. The latest version will be
      available on this page.
